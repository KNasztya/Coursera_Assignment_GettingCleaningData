In "run_analysis.R" you find all the steps from downloading and reading the input data to the final tidy data set, which follows the following steps:

- 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent final tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- and then generates a tidy data text file that meets the principles of tidy data.

The "My_codebook" has the specific description of the tidy data file contents.
